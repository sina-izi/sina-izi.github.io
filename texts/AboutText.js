  Hi! I'm Sina, I am a Developer who studied Computer Engineering at NYU. I think I almost maxed out these stats:

  - Extroversion: I love making new friends and hanging out with them!

  - Creativity: I'm really good at coming up with creative ideas. I consider this to be my superpower!

  - Adaptability: I am change! No but seriously! I love to be challenged and try new things.

  However, I'm on a quest to level up the stats below. I'd say that they are a work in progress :D

  - Proactiveness: Sometimes I just need to take the step. Enough with the ideas :/

  - Experience: I do want to learn more and become a way better Engineer, and a better Leader.

  - Story-Telling: I guess we all know the power of great stories! and I'm working on mine.
